# gramdicmaker2016

This repo contains source code I wrote working on my BA thesis (which was followed by a talk on the Dialogue conference). You can find an article describing what the project was about [here](http://www.dialog-21.ru/media/3414/mazurovam.pdf).

The project history's available [here](https://bitbucket.org/mvmazurova/gramdics).
